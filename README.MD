# SPATIAL CON

## About
This project is a Spring boot based REST API to convert SOSI files to other formats using [Sosicon v 1.0](https://github.com/espena/sosicon). This repo contains the dockerfile used to setup a docker container running the API.

## SOSI Files
SOSI, an acronym for "Samordnet Opplegg for Stedfestet Informasjon," translates from Norwegian as "Coordinated Approach for Spatial Information." However, it's more frequently referred to in English as the "Systematic Organization of Spatial Information." This standard encompasses uniform definitions for aspects like geometry, topology, data quality, coordinate systems, as well as attributes and metadata. The Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority developed this open standard, launching its first version (1.0) in 1987. Since its initial release, SOSI has undergone continuous revisions and enhancements. Its development is steadily aligning with international standards, particularly the ISO 19100 series. The ongoing efforts in this area are led by ISO/TC211, currently under the chairmanship of Olaf Ã˜stensen from the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority.
